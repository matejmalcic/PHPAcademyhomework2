Task1

Output given alphabet: 'a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z' in each row without commas. Number of rows equals number of letters in your name.
Each row will have one letter from your name bolded, starting from first letter and proceeding in order. Example tomislav, will have "t" bolded in first row, "o" in second, etc.
Each row will have one letter from your name underlined, starting from last letter and proceeding in reversed order. Example tomislav, will have "v" underlined in first row, "a" in second, etc.
Start with variable $name='yourname'; with your name assigned as string, and proceed to work with it until you get what you need.

Task2

Output given alphabet: 'a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z' in each row without commas. Number of rows equals number of letters in an alphabet.
Each next row will continue from next letter of alphabet (so that we can read alphabet when looking both horizontally and vertically).
Once alphabet stops in a row it will start again, but only for number letters that need to match number of letters in the first line.
Starting from 13th position (letter m), draw a snake like pattern that will bounce of edges.
